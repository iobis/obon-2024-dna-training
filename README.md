# OBIS training for eDNA data sharing üê†

Training documents for the OBON projects meeting in November 2024. 

This training is meant for eDNA data providers interested in the formatting and addition of eDNA data to the OBIS database. The training runs through simple steps in adding eDNA data. In addition, we will try out how to access and work with eDNA data already in OBIS. 

## Example dataset

The example eDNA dataset is available at in the [dataset folder](dataset), and an example [R markdown solution](solutions/pieter.Rmd) to the data cleaning exercise is also available. To start with your own work, you can clone the repository to your computer, and copy the solution "pieter.Rmd", to a file with your own name.
